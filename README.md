# Keeping Tabs
I used this to learn about how to use Firebase Authentication and Firestore in React. I learned about making queries, creating and updating documents, setting up authentication providers, and more!

Left me wondering about: 
- Improving state management with Redux
- Hiding API keys with .env files
- Firebase Security Rules
